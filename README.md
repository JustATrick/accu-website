# ACCU Website

Notes on functionality for the accu-website

## What are we aiming at?

We'd like a system to support:

*   Ease of Use
*   Ease of Publishing
*   Ease of Submission

The next milestone is to have use cases and wireframes to present to the next
committee meeting, which will be sometime in September.

* **Q. How much prioritization should we have done by then?** Moscow?
* **Q. How much feasibility work should we have done by then?**

## User Types / "Stakeholders"

*   Member
*   Non-Member
*   Editor
    *    Committee Member
    *    Journal Editor
*   Membership Secretary
*   Mailing List Moderator

## Functions

### Member Account Info

We took a look at some of the pages surrounding account info for Members.
Though it mostly works, it's hard for users to find, and clunky when they do.

**We need to decide whether it's feasible to set up a new site that delegates
this stuff to the existing one.** I think doing so would go against our aim of
making the site easy to use, but might allow us to make some visible progress.
I suspect that doing a new membership system would take a lot of effort.

#### User Stories

* As a Member I want to update my mailing info so that the journals reach me

* As a Member I want to renew my subscription so I can keep benefiting

* As a Member I want to control how you contact me, so I don't feel I'm being
  spammed

* As a Member I want to see a receipt of my last payment, so I can commit tax
  fraud

* As a Non-Member I want to find out about the benefits and costs of
  Membership, so I can decide whether to join

* As a Non-Member I want to join the ACCU so I can take advantage of the
  benefits

* As a Membership Secretary I want to do loads of reporting things...(do we
  need to go into this)?

### Articles

### Mailing Lists

The current mailing lists sit outside of the CMS-backed website, and are managed
by Mailman. This means that we found lists that we know exist were not shown on the
website. Also, it's hard to ensure that only authorised members can join.

#### User Stories

* As a Non-Member I want to join public ACCU mailing lists so I can join the
  discussion

* As a Member I want to join private ACCU mailing lists so I can join the
  discussion

* As a Committee Member I want all mailing lists advertised on the website, so
  that we attract people to ACCU

* As a Non-Member I want to see the archives of public mailing lists, so I can
  find out what sort of discussion goes on

* As a Member I want to search the archives of mailing lists, so I can find
  that cool thing I only half remember
